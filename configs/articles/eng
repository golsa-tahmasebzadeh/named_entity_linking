Throughout the years, that seed of an idea was nurtured and cultivated by the couple's descendants, starting with their children -- Jesus \"Chung' Guerrero, Agnes Guerrero, Herman T. Guerrero, Juan \"Pan\" Guerrero, Florencio \"Bobby\"' Guerrero, Margarita Guerrero, Annie G. Hayes, Rudolfo Guerrero, Joseph \"Lee Pan\" Guerrero and Leonora Guerrero -- who carefully reared the seeds of that idea and used it to expand some more, making the bakery a sanctuary of locally produced bread and pastries that caters to a diverse market here and abroad and as a medium to 'give back to the community.", "source": {"uri": "saipantribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saipan Tribune"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.saipantribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ST_Headlines_SAIPAN-TRIBUNE.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 310175700}]
